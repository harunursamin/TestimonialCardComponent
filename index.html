                      joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                      “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
                      bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have
                      heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I
                      signed up for the free intro course and found it
                      incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                      weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                      Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
                      careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
                code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
                learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about
                the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
                during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
